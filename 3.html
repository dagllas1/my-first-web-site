<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript lets you add interactive features to your Web sites,
including dynamically updated content, controlled multimedia,
animated images, and much more. Developed in partnership between W3C
and University CÃ´te d'Azur, this introductory course has been designed
to help Web developers have an understanding of the basic concepts of
the language. We present JavaScript best practices by means of many
interactive examples, some of which being demonstrated in live coding videos.</p>
